    <p style="color: white" id="text3">Hi! I'm Akira, a student | developer | music producer. 
        A student at UBC, currently pursuing a combined major in Computer Science and Business.</p>

        <h2 id="text2">I am an avid software developer and self-taught music producer working in Logic Pro X.</h2>
        <p id="textp">Please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like to talk about my work or learn more about what I do. </p>
        <p id="textp">Some of my past projects include a <a href="https://github.com/akyukii/nwHacks-2023" style="color: #133A1B">Virtual Interview Prep Tool</a> made with OpenCV/Mediapipe and Microsoft Video Indexer, and a <a href="https://github.com/akyukii/sps-summer2022-team-10" style="color: #133A1B">Shopping List Cost Comparison Tool</a> using Java Servlets and the Kroger API. I'm also looking to create an Image to Overleaf code converter and I'm looking for dev collaboraters to work with me on this project. </p>
        <p id="textp">I am also currently working on data algorithms and doing Leetcode. I created a UBCV Leetcode server to discuss questions and solutions to problems. You can join <a href="https://discord.gg/6BJEKSWsJE" style="color: #133A1B">here</a>. </p>
        <p id="textp">Alongside my personal progress in software development, I am also taking five courses towards my <a href="https://mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/bucs" style="color: #133A1B">Bachelor's degree in Computer Science + Business</a>. These courses are: CPSC 213 (Computer Systems and Architecture), MATH 221 (Matrix Algebra), COMM 191 (Statistics and Applications), COMM 294 (Managerial Accounting), and COMM 298 (Fundamentals of Finance).</p>
        <p id="textp">As well, I balance my extracurriculars with my academics. I am a passionate music producer specializing in producing trap beats for emerging rap artists, as well as simply for fun. I find my inspiration mainly from listening to rap music and watching underground battles. Some of my favourite artists include: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/429wOEd8ummnOTS4gw3WcQ" style="color: #133A1B">MC Pharaoh (法老)</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/57r88WL8hFkqyew0E1zuFa" style="color: #133A1B">LEGGO</a> (From APEX), <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0fyaEHmSmZs2YWMgbruITA" style="color: #133A1B">Masiwei</a> (From Higher Brothers), Spylent, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0NWX8s7X9gtjad7sIB0uba?si=TThOXIj1SPS6kf5UsAbNNg" style="color: #133A1B">Capper</a>. 
            I'm also a fan of working out, and you can find me 5/7 days at either the ARC gym or the Birdcoop gym at UBC. Currently bulking (an excuse for me to continue binging snacks/beef jerky at 9pm :>). </p>
        <p id="textp">I'm involved with the UBC Blockchain club, as I am a web developer in charge of maintaining the club website. I'm also the head of Operations for UBC.LIVE, a social media account for all things UBC. I have a BUCS application guide, so go check it out on WeChat @UBC.LIVE!</p>
        <p id="textp">My next steps are to land an internship or research assistant position this summer and to go on co-op in 2023 Fall :) With regards to my music career, I'm planning to upload and monetize my beats through the Netease Music Beat Store. I'd describe myself as someone who doesn't like to take responsibility of steering the direction of their life, 
        but at the same time, everything tends to fall in place as I imagine it to be. I believe that as long as I work hard, everything I want will eventually come to me. </p>
        <p id="textp">I'm on a journey to learn about cloud storage cryptography and how different approaches increase performance of cloud-based systems. I also would like to explore the possibilities of adapting computational models in the real world, specifically using machine learning and neural networks to build intelligent infrastructure. I'd like to invite you to join me on my journey as I venture through the world of algorithms and frameworks. </p>
