    <p style="color: white" id="text2">Hi! I'm Akira, I am a 15-year-old developer & music producer. 
        Also a student at the UBC Sauder School of Business, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in a combined major of Business and Computer Science.</p>

        <h2 id="text2">I am an avid software developer and self-taught music producer with previous experience in music harmony.</h2>
        <p id="textp">Please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like to talk about my work or learn more about what I do. </p>
        <p id="textp">My past experiences lie mainly in the web2 industry though I'd like to dip my toes into web3. Please reach out if you have any prior experience regarding web3 projects: I'd love to learn more! Some of my past projects include a todo task tracker made from React, an Instagram clone using React, and I'm currently working on a Netflix Clone to learn more about the MERN stack. </p>
        <p id="textp">I am also currently working on data algorithms and doing Leetcode. I created a UBCV Leetcode server to discuss questions and solutions to problems. You can join <a href="https://discord.gg/6BJEKSWsJE" style="font: #fff">here</a>. </p>
        <p id="textp">Alongside my personal progress in software development, I am also taking five courses towards my <a href="https://mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/bucs" style="font: #fff">Bachelor's degree in Business and Computer Science</a>. These courses are: MATH 105 (Integral Calculus), CPSC 121 (Models of Computation and Hardware), ECON 102 (Macroeconomics), COMM 292 (Organizational Behaviour and HR), and COMM 101 (Fundamentals of Business).</p>
        <p id="textp">As well, I balance my extracurriculars with my academics. I am a passionate music producer specializing in producing trap beats for emerging rap artists, as well as simply for fun. I find my inspiration mainly from listening to rap music and watching underground battles. Some of my favourite artists include: MC Pharaoh (法老), LEGGO (From APEX), Masiwei (From Higher Brothers), Spylent, and KeyNG (杨和苏). 
            I'm also a fan of working out (or maybe you could call me a gym rat ??), and you can find me 5/7 days at either the ARC gym or the Birdcoop gym at UBC. Currently bulking (an excuse for me to continue binging snacks/beef jerky at 9pm :>). </p>
        <p id="textp">I'm involved with the UBC Product Management Club, as I was the Product Sprint coordinator for curriculums. Moving forward, I'm planning to be involved in the creation of a club website and facilitating discussion events for PMC.
            I'm also an editor/writer for UBC.LIVE, a social media account for all things UBC written by students, for students. I have a BUCS application guide, so go check it out on WeChat @UBC.LIVE!</p>
        <p id="textp">Also, one more thing you may ask, why am I in university at 15? Long story short, I entered a very exciting program (the University Transition Program) in Grade 7 and met 20 other very exciting people. We studied together for two years, and then entered university. </p>
        <p id="textp">My next steps are to land an internship (preferrably a SWE position?) in the Summer of Year 2 and to apply to the UBC Science Co-op position once I am legally allowed to work :)</p>
