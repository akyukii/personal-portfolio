    <p style="color: white" id="text2">Hi! I'm Akira, 15-year-old developer & music producer. 
        Also a student at the UBC Sauder School of Business, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in a combined major of Business and Computer Science.</p>

        <h2 id="text2">I am an avid software developer and self-taught music producer working in Logic Pro X.</h2>
        <p id="textp">Please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like to talk about my work or learn more about what I do. </p>
        <p id="textp">My past experiences lie mainly in the web2 industry though I'd like to dip my toes into web3. Please reach out if you have any prior experience regarding web3 projects: I'd love to learn more! Some of my past projects include a <a href="https://github.com/akyukii/task-tracker" style="font: #fff">todo task tracker</a> made from React, an <a href="https://github.com/akyukii/instagram-clone" style="font: #fff">Instagram clone using React, and I'm currently working on a Netflix Clone to learn more about the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack. </p>
        <p id="textp">I am also currently working on data algorithms and doing Leetcode. I created a UBCV Leetcode server to discuss questions and solutions to problems. You can join <a href="https://discord.gg/6BJEKSWsJE" style="font: #fff">here</a>. </p>
        <p id="textp">Alongside my personal progress in software development, I am also taking five courses towards my <a href="https://mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/bucs" style="font: #fff">Bachelor's degree in Business and Computer Science</a>. These courses are: MATH 105 (Integral Calculus), CPSC 121 (Models of Computation and Hardware), ECON 102 (Macroeconomics), COMM 292 (Organizational Behaviour and HR), and COMM 101 (Fundamentals of Business).</p>
        <p id="textp">As well, I balance my extracurriculars with my academics. I am a passionate music producer specializing in producing trap beats for emerging rap artists, as well as simply for fun. I find my inspiration mainly from listening to rap music and watching underground battles. Some of my favourite artists include: MC Pharaoh (法老), LEGGO (From APEX), Masiwei (From Higher Brothers), Spylent, and KeyNG (杨和苏). 
            I'm also a fan of working out (or maybe you could call me a gym rat ??), and you can find me 5/7 days at either the ARC gym or the Birdcoop gym at UBC. Currently bulking (an excuse for me to continue binging snacks/beef jerky at 9pm :>). </p>
        <p id="textp">I'm involved with the UBC Product Management Club, as I was the Product Sprint coordinator for curriculums. Moving forward, I'm planning to be involved in the creation of a club website and facilitating discussion events for PMC.
            I'm also an editor/writer for UBC.LIVE, a social media account for all things UBC written by students, for students. I have a BUCS application guide, so go check it out on WeChat @UBC.LIVE!</p>
        <p id="textp">Also, one more thing you may ask, why am I in university at 15? Long story short, I entered a very exciting program (the University Transition Program) in Grade 7 and met 20 other very exciting people. We studied together for two years, and then entered university. </p>
        <p id="textp">My next steps are to land an internship (preferrably a SWE position?) in the Summer of Year 2 and to apply to the UBC Science Co-op position once I am legally allowed to work :) With regards to my music career, I'm planning to upload and monetize my beats through the Netease Music Beat Store. I'd describe myself as someone who doesn't like to take responsibility of steering the direction of their life, 
        but at the same time, everything tends to fall in place as I imagine it to be. Funny story: I remember reading a news article in kindergarden about a 14-year-old who ended up in university. Guess that was me trying to signal past "me" to work hard :P</p>
        <p id="textp">Jokes aside, I'm on a journey to create more optimal virtual data storage facilities through cloud computing & explore the possibilities of adapting computational models in the real world, specifically using machine learning and neural networks to build intelligent infrastructure for predicting future outcomes. I'd like to invite you to join me on my journey. </p>
