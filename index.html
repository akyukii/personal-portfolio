    <p style="color: white" id="text3">Hi! I'm Akira, a student/developer/music producer. </p>
    <p style="color: white" id="text3">A student at UBC, currently pursuing a combined major in Computer Science and Business.</p>

        <h2 id="text2">I am an avid software developer and self-taught music producer working in Logic Pro X.</h2>
        <p id="textp">Please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like to talk about my work or learn more about what I do. </p>
        <p id="textp">Some of my past projects include a <a href="https://github.com/akyukii/nwHacks-2023" style="color: #133A1B">Virtual Interview Prep Tool</a> made with OpenCV/Mediapipe and Microsoft Video Indexer, and a <a href="https://github.com/akyukii/sps-summer2022-team-10" style="color: #133A1B">Shopping List Cost Comparison Tool</a> using Java Servlets and the Kroger API. I'm also looking to create an Image to Overleaf code converter and I'm looking for dev collaboraters to work with me on this project. </p>
        <p id="textp">I am currently working in the <a href="https://people.ece.ubc.ca/mjulia/ReSeSS.html" style="color: #133A1B">UBC ReSeSS Research Lab</a>, leading a team to develop a tool for detecting vulnerabilities in microservice-based applications. </p>
        <p id="textp">Alongside my personal progress in software development, I am also pursuing a <a href="https://mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/bucs" style="color: #133A1B">Bachelor's degree in Computer Science + Business</a>, with a minor in Honours Mathematics. For the upcoming term (2023 Fall), I will be joining Boeing Canada as a Software Development Intern in the flight test data analytics team. In 2024 Spring, I will be heading to Tsinghua University, one of the top universities in China, as a Go Global scholar.</p>
        <p id="textp">As well, I balance my extracurriculars with my academics. I am a passionate music producer specializing in producing beats for emerging rap artists, as well as simply for fun. I find my inspiration mainly from listening to rap music and watching underground battles. Some of my favourite Chinese artists include: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/429wOEd8ummnOTS4gw3WcQ" style="color: #133A1B">MC Pharaoh (法老)</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/57r88WL8hFkqyew0E1zuFa" style="color: #133A1B">LEGGO</a> (From APEX), <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0fyaEHmSmZs2YWMgbruITA" style="color: #133A1B">Masiwei</a> (From Higher Brothers), and Spylent. 
            I'm also a fan of working out, and you can find me 5/7 days at either the ARC gym or the Birdcoop gym at UBC. Currently bulking (an excuse for me to continue binging snacks/beef jerky at 9pm :>). </p>
        <p id="textp">I'm involved with the UBC Game Development Club as the treasurer, UBC Chinese Hiphop Club as the president, and UBC Artificial Intelligence club as VP Tech. Please feel free to reach out if you're interested in joining these clubs.</p>
        <p id="textp">My next steps are to enjoy my time at Boeing, present my vulnerability detection tool (MISTA) at the IBM TechXchange Conference, work on MISTA's paper for the ISSTA 2024 deadline, and learning discrete mathematics and statistical learning to land a quantitative trader intern in 2024 Summer/2025 Winter. </p>
        <p id="textp">I'm on a journey to learn about distributed systems and increasing the performance of cloud applications. I also would like to explore the possibilities of adapting computational models in the real world, specifically using machine learning and neural networks to build intelligent infrastructure. I'd like to invite you to join me on my journey as I venture through the world of algorithms and frameworks. </p>
