            <h2 id="text2">Leetcode Update</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff">This week, I was able to complete 32 leetcode problems focused on the topic of arrays and strings. I still remember the feeling I had when I was able to solve my first Leetcode hard - <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/" style="color: #fff">4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays</a> - by myself and with the optimal solution!! You can find my leetcode account <a href="https://leetcode.com/akyukii/" style="color: #fff">here</a>. </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="text2">Academics Update</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff">I have an ECON midterm next week; although I haven't studied yet, I'm here writing my updates because ECON is not the subject I'm good at. However, I am studying for my CPSC midterm two weeks later because the topic is a lot more intriguing and I find it more entertaining to study and learn about. We are covering things like DFAs, flip-flops, and direct/indirect proofs in the class, which could be confusing at times. </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="text2">Life Update</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff">I realized the importance of going to the gym with a buddy! I was much more competitive (hahah) when I worked out with a friend. We were much more efficient and made the gym experience a lot more enjoyable for each other. Win-win situation :) Further, I applied for an internship about two weeks ago and received an OA yesterday. I was super excited as I passed the resume screening, then I realized I applied for the Japan office of the company when I don't have a work permit there... Lowlight of the week !! </p>
