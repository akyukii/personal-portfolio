            <p style="color: #fff">This week, we were asked to create a personal website using the HTML + CSS + JS stack. After communicating with the project lead, I got the OK to merge my previous personal website (akkkkira.com) with the one I am currently working on in SPS. A couple of features I have added are a JS script to output a random fun fact about me and [add soon]. </p>

            <h2 id="text2">Vibes & Life</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff">I met a bunch of SPSers on LinkedIn, and all of them seem super humble and chill. We also had our virtual Kick-off event where I met my cohort of people from 10+ universities. I also met a student also at UBC, and I'd definitely like to meet them irl sometime. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> This week is also the week before my two midterms for my summer classes (both Commerce courses), and I've been spending a lot of time preparing for the exams, which coincidentally fall on the same day. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> I also had a 1:1 talk with my project lead, who introduced to me the work culture and daily tasks of SWEs at Google, and we had a quick chat about the industry and especially large tech companies' (FAANG) gestures about how they'd like to make the world a "better place", and how they fail to do so when things get hard. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> So far, SPS has been a chill program, but the workload is likely going to ramp up in July, where we'll get to create our own web app as a team. My team (10) is comprised of 4 individuals from different parts of North America and I look forward to creating something meaningful with them! </p>
