            <h2 id="text2">Leetcode Update</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff">Since I started roughly two weeks ago, I was able to complete 51 leetcode problems focused on the topics of array & strings and dynamic programming. This week I focused more on trying to complete problems alone and without looking at solutions. Although I haven't seen many different types of questions, I was able to complete over 30% of the questions on my own. I'd call that progress (?), mainly because I was not able to complete many, if any, last week. I was able to complete my second "hard" problem on my own, although with the assistance of searching up the merge-sort algorithm. Speaking of merge-sort, I was introduced to it during my CPSC 121 class, and we (my lab partner and I) built a sequential circuit that calculated the time complexity of that algorithm. Back to leetcode, next week I am focusing on linked lists - understanding the data structure and its properties. You can find my leetcode account <a href="https://leetcode.com/akyukii/" style="color: #fff">here</a>. </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="text2">Academics Update</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff">I have two midterms next week (math and computer science), I actually only studied a little bit for cpsc, but that will be my focus for this weekend and next week. Our math midterm is only for completion, so I use it as a tool to check how well I'm able to understand the content taught so far. Aside from midterms, I also have four assignments for commerce coming up within the next few weeks. Two presentations - one is on Sunday, the other is next week, and two papers - one is due three weeks from now, and the other is due the next week after the first paper is due. I feel a bit stressed out but at the same time at least I know what I need to do now... </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="text2">Life Update</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff"> This week was a social week for me. I ate food with four freinds and hung out with some more to study for exams and complete assignments. As an ENTJ, I feel like being around people makes me feel happier and I tend to have more energy. However, it is a lot less productive compared to studying alone, so I guess there's a trade-off there. Aside from that, I am working as a soundtrack producer for a gaming company and tons of work is going to be loaded on to me within the next couple of weeks. When passions become work, they're no longer that fun :( Not complaining though, ahahha.</p>
