            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> earlier this month, i got in a small conflict with one of my groupmates in comm 101 (business fundamentals course) and learned a lesson, or maybe not. I don't know. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> through my conversation with her, she told me that many times, there is much more than just academics. basically, she told me to get a life. that's fair, to be honest, because i wasn't very engaged in anything for the first term, other than academics. i would often finish my classes, go back home, and study until i eat dinner, study more, make some music, and end my day. i felt burnt out very often during those times. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> however, the case was, she decided not to do her work for over a week and said "ah, many groups still didn't begin yet, we're good." I didn't think that, because i was someone who wanted to finish everything before schedule. that's just one of my traits. we ended up arguing about who was right, and it wasted a good amount of my time (in which i could be studying for my econ midterm). horrible. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> then, she asked me to join a voice call with her. we were friends, so i agreed :)</p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> she told me some very cliche things: "no one defines who you are, and if they do, don't give a fuck about them"; "show more than your grades and your career, you're worth more than that"; "meet a group of people who genuinely cares about you, it's truly a beautiful experience"; etc, etc. I didn't know what to respond honestly, because i was told at a young age: "get a good career, focus on studying, your grades need to be good, your parents are doing so much for you... etc." </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> i discussed this with another friend from high school. she told me not to give a fuck about what my groupmate said. because, after all, i had a life(ish). i had friends. i hung out with people. i was happy doing whatever i was doing, either studying or making music. i had people who genuinely cared about me, or so i think. maybe i'm just a clown, haha. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> <strong><em> though, i must say: </em></strong></p>
            <p style="color: #fff"> life is indeed more than just grades, but figure out your priorities. do things in life that will get you to where you want to be. </p>
