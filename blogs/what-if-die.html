            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> we, as mortal humans, are capable of dying in 1,025,594,402,492,069,688 methods each day. i could wake up and experience a heat stroke. i could die of frostbite. maybe the ozone suddenly breaks open and sunlight sets everything on fire. then i'd die from the carbon monoxide. or perhaps drown from the water from the sprinkler. or perhaps i could wake up with a pig in my bedroom and die of a heartstroke. or perhaps some serial killer comes into my room and kills me. i'll never know. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> however, i do know that once i get out of my bed successfully without dying, a doll could charge at me and kill me with that knife i used to cut up onions the day before. or my apartment could crumble into pieces, leaving me under heaps of wood and cement. i mean, metaphorically i am. instead of wood and cement, i am under heaps of an unknown substance called "other people's opinions". and i can't stop thinking about it, just like how i wouldn't escape from the tons of bricks above me. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> so, when will i die? from the day i graduate and start working a 9-5 job? from the day i start dating some unknown woman just to please my parents? from the day my child is born and i need to earn money to support my family? or.. from the day i say "i love you" to the woman who deep down doesn't love me back? i don't know. perhaps i'll die on a hospital bed, reminiscing over the moments i had to myself. in preschool. in elementary. in university. everything after that seems to have disappeared from my memori...#$**!! </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> so, when did i die?</p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> i don't want to die. i'm 15. i need to live to the standards of my parents. i am their investment. i live == the rate of return is increasing. i die == the financial intermediary goes bankrupt. or they were despicable little shits who scammed money and left. i came across one of them. the next time i do, though, they die. but what if i'm dead? a dead person can't kill someone else. but a live person can kill someone who is already dead. by forgetting them. they die physically and mentally. they disappear from the world. what a pity.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: #fff"> i want to dream of something. a waterpark perhaps, at night. i enter. a duck greets me, with its mouth wide open, welcoming me into its esophagus (the tube connecting the mouth to the stomach). i eat duck. duck now eats me. i wake up from my sleep. it's twenty-fifteen. </p>

            <p style="color: #fff"> <strong><em> what is dreamcore? </em></strong></p>
            <p style="color: #fff">Dreamcore is a surrealist aesthetic that uses motifs commonly associated with dreams, daydreams or nightmares, portrayed through media such as images, videos and, on occasion, music. Dreamcore shares many similarities with surreal memes; however, it does not rely on absurdist humor. Instead, dreamcore focuses on emulating the general feeling of a dream.</p>
