            <h2 id="text2">Leetcode Update</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff">I decided to take a break from Leetcode this week, mainly because I spent this week staying well-rested and recharging before finals. I'm currently at 72 solved. Next week, I'll dive back into Leetcode and focus on Linked list structures. You can find my leetcode account <a href="https://leetcode.com/akyukii/" style="color: #fff">here</a>. </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="text2">Academics Update</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff">This week, I did a minimal amount of studying as mentioned earlier, and I have a lot of catching up to do. However, I think that this week was very well-spent and my mental health has recovered significantly. </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="text2">Life Update</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff"> On Tuesday, I went to Amin√©'s concert with a friend of mine, and it was the first time I stayed outside until 11pm. It was a magical experience, and I really enjoyed the music and vibes. Though I had a pitch the day after, I was able to live in the moment and enjoy the show. New accomplishment! </p>
            <p style="color: #fff"> The sakura blossoms were blooming this week, so I spent some time in between classes to take pictures with a couple of friends on Lower mall. You can view the pictures below.</p>
            <p style="color: #fff"> On Saturday, I spent the first half of my day studying and learning ECON, and spent the afternoon working out, playing badminton, and having a fun time with friends. Another accomplishment! </p>
