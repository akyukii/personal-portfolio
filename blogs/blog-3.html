            <h2 id="text2">Leetcode Update</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff">This week I had a technical interview for an internship, but was caught off-guard when I got an nqueens question. I mainly decided to review data structures and algorithms this week, so I didn't complete many problems. I am at around 61 questions so far, but starting next week I will start back on my Leetcode grind. I'll be focusing more on sorting algorithms this week. You can find my leetcode account <a href="https://leetcode.com/akyukii/" style="color: #fff">here</a>. </p>

            <h2 id="text2">Academics Update</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff">This weekend was a slight breather after midterms. I didn't do much studying, but rather went outside to enjoy time with friends, many of which I haven't seen in a long time. Was definitely worth it!! </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="text2">Life Update</h2>
            <p style="color: #fff"> This week, I was elected as community director for the UBC Game Development Club, and I also interviewed for a dev position at UBC Blockchain. On top of that, I started working on music production (mainly just BGM and OST for now) for the company I'm interning at right now.</p>
            <p style="color: #fff"> Also, I had a super fun time this weekend. On Friday, I went outside for dinner with a friend I haven't seen in a couple of months at a restaurant called Rajio Public House. We then spent some time taking pictures with sakura blossoms, they were so pretty! On Saturday, I went out with a group of friends for lunch at Gyu-Kaku (Japanese BBQ) and then played a couple rounds of lazer tag. It reminded me of the good old times TwT. On Sunday, my friend invited me to his house for lunch (and it was so good :sob:) and I was invited to go check out a new store called Pokey Okey. It tasted pretty good :)</p>
